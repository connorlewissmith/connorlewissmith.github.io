## Spatial Analysis & CI/CD

[Upstream Fish Barrier Restoration Tool](https://upstream-cloud-run-jcypjvvn7a-uw.a.run.app/)

In collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, I spearheaded the development of a decision support tool aimed at optimizing fish barrier culvert restoration efforts. My role was pivotal in establishing habitat quality and quantity metrics that serve as the backbone of the tool's analytical capabilities. Leveraging my expertise in data science, I also implemented a continuous deployment pipeline, ensuring that the tool remains up-to-date and robust.

## Data Visualization

[West Coast Commercial Fisheries Participation Survey County-level Mapping Tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/connect/#/apps/9cc191e4-2cd2-497b-961e-e40def9ef747/access)

I built a Shiny application to visualize responses to NOAA's [West Coast Fisheries Participation Surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/west-coast-fisheries-participation-survey-results) for both 2017 and 2020. Over 1400 responses for each survey year were aggregated to the county level and can be compared with census county level data.

## Survey Research 


[Pilot Project: Climate Change Curriculum for Agricultural Analysts and Decision-Makers in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://pcc.uw.edu/blog/2022/06/08/first-steps-climate-change-curriculum-for-agricultural-analysts-and-decision-makers-in-sub-saharan-africa/)

I co-produced an 18 question pre-survey, a series of educational Youtube videos, and associated post-surveys to inform the development of a long term curriculum aimed at agricultural analyists and decision-makers across Sub-Saharan Africa with partners at the University of Washington's [Evans School Policy Analysis and Research Group](https://epar.evans.uw.edu/).
