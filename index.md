## Data Visualization 

[West Coast Commercial Fisheries Participation Survey County-level Mapping Tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/connect/#/apps/9cc191e4-2cd2-497b-961e-e40def9ef747/access)


I built a Shiny application to visualize responses to NOAA's [West Coast Fisheries Participation Surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/west-coast-fisheries-participation-survey-results) for both 2017 and 2020. Over 1400 responses for each survey year were aggregated to the county level and can be compared with census county level data.

## Survey Research 


[Pilot Project: Climate Change Curriculum for Agricultural Analysts and Decision-Makers in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://pcc.uw.edu/blog/2022/06/08/first-steps-climate-change-curriculum-for-agricultural-analysts-and-decision-makers-in-sub-saharan-africa/)

I co-produced an 18 question pre-survey, a series of educational Youtube videos, and associated post-surveys to inform the development of a long term curriculum aimed at agricultural analyists and decision-makers across Sub-Saharan Africa with partners at the University of Washington's [Evans School Policy Analysis and Research Group](https://epar.evans.uw.edu/).
