### Shiny Applications 

[West Coast Commercial Fisheries Participation Survey County-level Mapping Tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/connect/#/apps/9cc191e4-2cd2-497b-961e-e40def9ef747/access)

I built a Shiny application to visualize responses to NOAA's [West Coast Fisheries Participation Surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/west-coast-fisheries-participation-survey-results) for both 2017 and 2020. Over 1400 responses for each survey year were aggregated to the county level and can be compared with census county level data.
